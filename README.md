# VulnerableApp-nginx

VulnerableApp nginx is used to build a distributed farm of Vulnerable Applications such that they can be built agnostic to tech stacks. One of the key highlights of Owasp VulnerableApp is clear demarcation between UI, Backend components and there interactions in a way that there is a well defined schema which is used by the UI to call backend. Now if any vulnerable applications provides that schema then UI component can work for that vulnerable application.

VulnerableApp nginx is a bridge between the UI and Backend components such that multiple vulnerable applications can be served from the same sight of pane.

### VulnerableApp becomes Distributed !!!
